# SEP Assignment - 2D Dungeon Crawler

#####Workflow: Feature Branching* - The master is kept clean and every seperate feature is worked on in it's own branch. Once a feature is completed without bugs it will be reviewed  by the group for a merge into the master.

#####Spare roles:
  * Spriting (Visuals)
  * OpenAL (Audio)

*The alternative workflow suggested was Continuous Integration however this was predicted to lead to too many broken builds over time which would have impeded testing of a persons respective feature.
