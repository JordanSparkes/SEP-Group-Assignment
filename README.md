# Sprite handler Branch

##### This feature has now been put into its own seperate branch. In doing so allows collabs such as creating the Player object to use the sprite stuff via merging/pulling without also receiving the AI and enemy stuff. It also allows me to seperately merge it into the master when it's completely done
